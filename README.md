## REG NO: 212223060032
## NAME: CHANDRU R
## Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using an LLM - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application for **Academic Planning and Research Assistance**, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

## Apparatus Required
- Python **3.x**
- Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI API / Web Interface)
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) or simple chatbot interface
- Text editor (VS Code / PyCharm)
- GitHub for version control and repository upload

---

## Procedure

1.  **Define Core Requirements**
    -   **Academic Scheduling:** Manage deadlines and study sessions.
    -   **Research Summarization:** Extract key points from text/articles.
    -   **Citation/Referencing Assistance:** Generate citations in a specified format.
    -   **Concept Clarification:** Explain complex topics concisely.
    -   **Adaptive Study Planning:** Suggest resources and topics based on current knowledge gaps.

2.  **Construct Prompts for Each Feature**
    -   **Academic Scheduling**
        -   "I have a presentation due next Friday. Break down the preparation into 3 steps."
        -   "Set a study timer for my 'Machine Learning' course from 7 PM to 8:30 PM."
    -   **Research Summarization**
        -   "Summarize this abstract into three bullet points for a presentation." (Followed by the text/abstract)
        -   "What are the main findings in the last two paragraphs of the provided text?"
    -   **Citation/Referencing Assistance**
        -   "Generate an APA 7th edition citation for a book with author John Doe, title 'AI Fundamentals', published in 2024 by Tech Press."
    -   **Concept Clarification**
        -   "Explain the concept of 'prompt engineering' to a non-technical person using a simple analogy."
        -   "What is the difference between a 'convolutional' and a 'recurrent' neural network?"

3.  **Simulate User Interaction**
    -   Implement a **simple chatbot/CLI** where the user inputs academic queries.
    -   The LLM processes the prompt and provides structured, academic-focused outputs.

4.  **Collect Feedback & Adapt Responses**
    -   Example: If the user indicates a summary was too brief, the assistant adapts by providing a more detailed summary next time.
    -   Maintain a **local memory file** (JSON/CSV) to store preferred citation styles (e.g., APA, MLA) and course names.

5.  **(Optional) Integrate Basic Memory**
    -   Store the user's major and active courses.
    -   Adapt suggestions to prioritize tasks related to the most critical upcoming course or project.

## Expected Output

### Example LLM Response

**Personal Academic & Research Assistant Features:**

✅ **Academic Task Planner**
-   Accepts natural language planning queries (*"Break down my research paper draft."*).
-   Organizes tasks by **course/subject** and **priority**.
-   Provides **daily/weekly academic focus summaries**.

✅ **Research Summarizer**
-   Extracts **key arguments** and **methodologies** from provided texts.
-   Can generate summaries in various styles (e.g., concise, detailed, presentation-ready).

✅ **Citation Generator**
-   Supports multiple popular formats (e.g., **APA, MLA, Chicago**).
-   Stores the user's default preferred citation style.

✅ **Concept Explainer**
-   Simplifies complex academic concepts with **analogies** and **step-by-step explanations**.
-   Compares and contrasts related terms effectively.

# Result:

The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal academic and research assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:

* Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to specific **academic and research applications**.
* Foster creativity by designing features suited to their **study habits and academic needs**.
* Learn advanced prompt engineering techniques for **structured data output** (e.g., citations, summaries).
* Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in **supporting their educational journey**.

I hope this alternative, academically focused example meets your needs! Let me know if you have any other questions.
